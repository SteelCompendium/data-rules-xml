  <effects>
    <effect type="mundane">Until the start of your next turn, the target has the following benefits: - Their size and stability increase by 2, with any size 1 target becoming size 3. Each creature who is within the target&apos;s new space slides to the nearest unoccupied space, ignoring stability. If the target doesn&apos;t have space to grow, they grow as much as they can and become restrained until the effect ends. - They have fire immunity 10. - Their strikes deal extra fire damage equal to twice your Reason score. - When the target force moves a creature or object, the forced movement distance gains a +2 bonus. - They can use their highest characteristic instead of Might for Might power rolls.</effect>
    <effect type="mundane" name="Persistent 2">The effect lasts until the start of your next turn. Additionally, at the start of your turn, the target can spend 2 Recoveries.</effect>
