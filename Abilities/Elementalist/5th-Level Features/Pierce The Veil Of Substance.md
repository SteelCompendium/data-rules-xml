    <effect type="mundane">Solidity is merely a suggestion to you. Mundane barriers that are 1 square thick or less do not block your senses or line of effect. You can only sense or have line of effect past one such barrier at a time.
Additionally, whenever you use a void ability, you or one ally within distance of the ability can teleport a number of squares equal to your Reason score.</effect>
