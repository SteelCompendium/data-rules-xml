  <effects>
    <effect type="mundane">You can speak with and understand animals, beasts, and plant creatures, even if they don&apos;t share a language with you. Your ability to communicate with these creatures doesn&apos;t make them inherently more intelligent, but you can use Reason instead of Presence while making tests to influence them.
Additionally, you can touch a living plant that is not a plant creature to communicate with it telepathically. You can use words to communicate with the plant, but it communicates with you only by transmitting feelings and sensations that can&apos;t be overly specific.</effect>
