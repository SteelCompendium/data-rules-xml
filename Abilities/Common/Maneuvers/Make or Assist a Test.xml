    <effect type="mundane">Many tests are maneuvers if made in combat. Searching a chest with a Reason test, picking a door&apos;s lock with an Agility test, or lifting a portcullis with a Might test would all be maneuvers. Assisting a test is also a maneuver in combat (see Assist a Test in Chapter 9: Tests).
Complex or time-consuming tests might require a main action if made in combatâ€”or could take so long that they can&apos;t be made during combat at all. Other tests that take no time at all, such as a Reason test to recall lore about mummies, are usually free maneuvers in combat. The Director has the final say regarding which tests can be made as maneuvers.</effect>
