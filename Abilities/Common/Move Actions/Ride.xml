  <effects>
    <effect type="mundane">A creature can take the Ride move action only while mounted on another creature (see [Mounted Combat](#page-293-0) below). When a creature takes the Ride move action, they cause their mount to move up to the mount&apos;s speed, taking the rider with them. Alternatively, a creature can use the Ride move action to have their mount use the Disengage move action as a free triggered action. A creature can use the Ride move action only once per round. A mounted creature can only have this move action applied to them once per round. This movement can be broken up with the rider&apos;s maneuver and main action however they wish.</effect>
