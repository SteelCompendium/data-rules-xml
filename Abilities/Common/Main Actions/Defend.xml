  <effects>
    <effect type="mundane">When a creature takes the Defend main action, ability rolls made against them have a double bane until the start of their next turn. Additionally, you have a double edge on tests when called for to resist environmental effects or a creature&apos;s traits or abilities. A creature gains no benefit from this action while another creature is taunted by them (see [Conditions](#page-91-2) in [Chapter 5: Classes](#page-83-2)).</effect>
