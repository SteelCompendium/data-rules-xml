  <effects>
    <effect type="mundane">You are empowered by your audience, near and far. You can&apos;t be made frightened, and if you are prone, you can stand up as a free maneuver.
Additionally, whenever you spend a Recovery, you can forgo regaining Stamina to invoke the roar of an invisible applauding audience. You and each ally within 3 squares of you gains temporary Stamina equal to 10 + the number of active bonds from your Scene Partner feature + either your Victories or the number of players in your game (whichever is higher).</effect>
