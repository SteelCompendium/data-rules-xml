    <effect type="mundane">When you finish a respite, you can prepare a magic meal using local flora for any companions who rested with you. Choose two of the following benefits for creatures who consume the meal:
- Each creature gains immunity to acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic damage equal to your level. You can choose this benefit twice, choosing a different damage immunity each time.
- Each creature gains 20 temporary Stamina.
- Each creature gains a +1 bonus to speed.
- Each creature gains a +1 bonus to saving throws.
- Each creature gains an edge on tests made to influence other creatures.
Each benefit lasts until the creature who gains it finishes another respite.</effect>
