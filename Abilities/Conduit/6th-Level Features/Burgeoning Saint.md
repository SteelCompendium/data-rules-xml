- You gain an edge on Presence tests made to interact with other creatures.
- Whenever you deal damage to an enemy, you can spend a Recovery.
- You have corruption immunity 10 or holy immunity 10 (your choice).
- Your clothing and equipment changes in a way that reflects your status as your deity&apos;s chosen champion, such as ordinary robes turning into gold vestments or a simple dagger becoming a wicked blade with intricate etching.</effect>
