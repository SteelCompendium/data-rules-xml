  <effects>
    <effect type="mundane">You can speak to the target if they are a creature who has died within the last 24 hours and who can speak a language you know, even if they are just a head. The target regards you as they would have in life, and you might need to make tests to influence them and convince them to speak with you. The trauma of dying can make a creature&apos;s memory of that event hazy, but the target otherwise knows all they knew in life. After 1 minute, the effect ends. You can&apos;t use this ability on the same creature twice.
##### Hands of the Maker
You have the following ability.
###### Hands of the Maker
*You craft objects with the power of your mind.*
| **Magic**   | **Maneuver** |
| ----------- | -----------: |
| **üìè Self** |  **üéØ Self** |</effect>
    <effect type="mundane">You create a mundane object of size 1S or smaller. You can maintain a number of objects created this way equal to your Intuition score. You can destroy an object created this way with a thought, no matter how far you are from it (no action required).
##### Inner Light
Each time you finish a respite, you can choose yourself or one ally who is also finishing a respite to gain the benefit of a divine ritual. You place a ray of morning light into the chosen character&apos;s soul, granting them a +1 bonus to saving throws that lasts until you finish another respite.
##### Inspired Deception
The gods favor your thievery with magic. Whenever you make a test that uses a skill you have from the intrigue skill group, you can use Intuition on the test instead of another characteristic.
##### Oracular Visions
Your deity rewards you with hazy visions of things to come. Each time you earn 1 or more Victories, you earn an equal number of fate points. Whenever you or a creature within 10 squares makes a test, you can spend 1 fate point to tap into a vision of the outcome, granting that creature an edge on the test. You lose any remaining fate points when you finish a respite.
##### Protective Circle
You can spend 10 uninterrupted minutes to create a protective circle on the ground large enough to hold one size 1 creature. The circle lasts for 24 hours, until you create another, or until you dismiss it (no action required). Only creatures you designate at the time of drawing the circle can enter and exit the area. While in the protective circle, a creature can&apos;t be targeted by strikes.
##### Revitalizing Ritual
Each time you finish a respite, you can choose yourself or one ally who is also finishing a respite to gain the benefit of a divine ritual. The chosen character gains a bonus to their recovery value equal to your level that lasts until you finish another respite.
##### Sanctified Weapon
As a respite activity, you can bless a weapon. Any creature who wields the weapon gains a +1 bonus to rolled damage with abilities that use the weapon. This benefit lasts until you finish another respite.</effect>
