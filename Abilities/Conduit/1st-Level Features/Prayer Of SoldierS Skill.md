    <effect type="mundane">Your god gives your mind the training of a soldier. You can wear light armor and wield light weapons effectively, even though you don&apos;t have a kit. While you wear light armor, you gain a +3 bonus to Stamina, and that bonus increases by 3 at 4th, 7th, and 10th levels. While you wield a light weapon, you gain a +1 damage bonus with weapon abilities, including free strikes. You can use light armor treasures and light weapon treasures.
If you have a kit, you can&apos;t take this blessing.</effect>
