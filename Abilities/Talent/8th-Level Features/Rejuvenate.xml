    <effect type="mundane" name="Effect">Choose two of the following effects:
- The target can spend any number of Recoveries.
- The target gains 1 of their Heroic Resource, and can end any effects on them that are ended by a saving throw or that end at the end of their turn.
- The target gains 2 surges, and gains a +3 bonus to speed until the end of the encounter.</effect>
    <effect type="mundane" name="Strained">You and the target both permanently grow visibly younger (the equivalent of 20 human years, to the minimum of an 18-yearold). Additionally, you are weakened and slowed (save ends).</effect>
