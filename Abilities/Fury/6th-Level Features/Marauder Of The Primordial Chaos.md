  <effects>
    <effect type="mundane">As your connection to the power of the Primordial Chaos grows ever stronger, you automatically sense any elemental creatures or magic sources of elemental power, such as a lava pool or a lake overlapping with Quintessence, within 1 mile of you.
Additionally, you can speak with elemental creatures, and when you are in a negotiation with an elemental, you treat your Renown as 1 higher than usual. This stacks with the increase to your effective Renown provided by the Nature&apos;s Knight aspect feature (see 3rd-Level Features). When any elemental first becomes aware of you in combat, if they have P &lt; AVERAGE, they are frightened of you (save ends).</effect>
