  <effects>
    <effect type="mundane">You have learned to leverage your marked foes&apos; psychology and goad them into acting before they&apos;re tactically ready. Whenever a creature marked by you uses a strike that targets you or any ally within your line of effect, you can use a free triggered action to change the target of the strike to you or another ally within your line of effect.</effect>
