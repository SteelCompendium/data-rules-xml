    <effect type="mundane" name="Mark Benefit">When you or any ally makes a strike against a creature marked by you, you can spend 2 focus to have the character making the strike shift up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score before the strike is resolved. If you didn&apos;t make the strike, you can make this shift as well. If you did make the strike, one ally within 10 squares of you can make this shift as well.</effect>
