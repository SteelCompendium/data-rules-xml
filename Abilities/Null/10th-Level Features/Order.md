  <effects>
    <effect type="mundane">You have an epic resource called order. Each time you finish a respite, you gain order equal to the XP you gain. You can spend order on your abilities as if it were discipline.
At the start of a combat encounter, you can spend 1 order to increase the size of your Null Field by 1 until the end of the encounter.
Order remains until you spend it.</effect>
