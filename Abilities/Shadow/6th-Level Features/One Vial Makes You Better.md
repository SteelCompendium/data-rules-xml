  <effects>
    <effect type="mundane">You ready, hand, or lob a potion to each target, who can immediately quaff the potion (no action required). If they don&apos;t drink the potion right away, they must use the Use Consumable maneuver to consume it later. The potion loses its potency at the end of the encounter. A creature who drinks the potion can spend up to 2 Recoveries, and has acid immunity, fire immunity, or poison immunity (their choice) equal to your level until the end of the encounter.</effect>
