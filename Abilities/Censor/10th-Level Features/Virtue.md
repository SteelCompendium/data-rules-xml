  <effects>
    <effect type="mundane">You have an epic resource called virtue. Each time you finish a respite, you gain virtue equal to the XP you gain. You can spend virtue on your abilities as if it were wrath.
Additionally, you can spend 3 virtue to access one of your deity&apos;s domains that you usually don&apos;t have access to. When you do, you can use that domain&apos;s features until you finish another respite.
Virtue remains until you spend it.</effect>
