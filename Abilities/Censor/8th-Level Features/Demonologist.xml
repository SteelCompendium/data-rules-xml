  <effects>
    <effect type="mundane">The most esoteric secrets of your order teach you that to defeat your enemy, you must understand them. You treat your Renown as 2 higher than usual when dealing with demons, devils, and other agents of chaos. If you successfully complete a negotiation with one of these creatures, you gain an edge on power rolls made against them and can use your Judgment ability against them as a free triggered action before an encounter begins.</effect>
