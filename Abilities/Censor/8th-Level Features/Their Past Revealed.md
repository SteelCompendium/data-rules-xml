  <effects>
    <effect type="mundane">Your constant fragmentary visions become clearer, and can be honed to understand the past of creatures you interact with. While speaking with any creature, you can make a medium Presence test to see visions from their past. On a success, you see a clear view of any subject related to the creature&apos;s past that you wish to understand. On a success with a consequence, you see two visions, one false and one true. On a failure, you lose 2d6 Stamina.</effect>
