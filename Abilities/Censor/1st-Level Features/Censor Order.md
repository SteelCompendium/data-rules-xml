  <effects>
    <effect type="mundane">Censors are the will of their god made physically manifest, and you act as your god&apos;s agent in the world. As you shoulder that responsibility, you choose a censor order from the following options, each of which grants you a skill. (*Quick Build:* Paragon.)
- **Exorcist:** You specialize in hunting your order&apos;s hidden enemies, knowing that an open mind is an unguarded fortress. You have the Read Person skill.
- **Oracle:** Corruption has deep tendrils that can be missed, leading you to specialize in uncovering clandestine threats to your order. You have the Magic skill.
- **Paragon:** Without a strong example and a firm hand, the weak will be corrupted. You specialize in setting an example for your order. You have the Lead skill.
Your censor order is your subclass, and your choice of order determines many of the features you&apos;ll gain as you gain new levels.</effect>
