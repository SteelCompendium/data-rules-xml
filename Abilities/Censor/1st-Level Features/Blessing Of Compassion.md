  <effects>
    <effect type="mundane">You exude a magic presence that can soothe those willing to socially engage with you. You gain an edge on any test made to assist another creature with a test.
Additionally, when you are present at the start of a negotiation, one NPC of your choice has their patience increased by 1 (to a maximum of 5), and the first test made to influence them gains an edge.</effect>
