  <effects>
    <effect type="mundane">Each time you finish a respite, you can choose one hero&apos;s weapon, including your own, to channel supernatural power as an implement of your god&apos;s wrath. The weapon becomes magic and gains the following benefits until your next respite:
- Strikes with the weapon deal extra holy damage equal to the wielder&apos;s highest characteristic score.
- Any creature struck by the weapon who has holy weakness and has P &lt; STRONG is frightened and weakened (save ends).
- Any minion targeted by a strike using the weapon dies. That minion&apos;s Stamina maximum is removed from the minion Stamina pool before any damage is applied to the rest of the squad.
- The weapon&apos;s wielder can&apos;t be made frightened.</effect>
