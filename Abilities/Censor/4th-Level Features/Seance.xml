  <effects>
    <effect type="mundane">You can commune with a network of spirits. As a respite activity, you speak the name of a creature who died and isn&apos;t undead. If the creature&apos;s spirit is free and willing to speak with you, they appear and you can have a conversation with them. During this time, the creature responds to you as they would have in life. If the creature isn&apos;t free or willing to appear, you can speak another name or choose another respite activity.</effect>
