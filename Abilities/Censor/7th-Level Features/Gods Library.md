  <effects>
    <effect type="mundane">You can gain access to information you need through prayer, so that you no longer require research materials for crafting and research projects (see [Chapter 12: Downtime Projects](#page-307-2)). Additionally, you add your level to project rolls you make for crafting and research projects. You also have any skills in the lore skill group you don&apos;t already have, and you gain a number of skills from any other skill groups equal to the number of skills you had in the lore skill group before you gained this feature.</effect>
